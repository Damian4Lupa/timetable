The application searches for connections between cities (bus and train), sorts data and displays the fastest connection.

Connection searches operate between the 10 largest cities in Great Britain: London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sheffield, Manchester, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Bristol and Cardiff. The base can be expanded.

At each stage of the journey, the application displays its duration and approximate cost.
